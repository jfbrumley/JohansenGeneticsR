This is a repository created by Jacob Brumley, for the use of the Johansen Lab students. This repository includes an RMarkdown document that contains the code for population genetic analyses in R using various packages, sample data sets (with explanations) in the "inputs" folder, and `.html` document of the RMarkdown.

R is a statistical software that with rising importance in the field of Biology for data analysis. This rising importance is centered around the free download, broad statistical power, and reproducibility. Various packages have been produced for the R software to run various statistical analyses, including for analyses in the study of **population genetics**. 

This repository focuses on the use of the following packages to conduct a standard suit of population genetic analyses:
* `adegenet`
* `pegas`
* `PopGenReport`
* `diveRsity`
* `hierfstat`
* `genepop`
* `mmod`

and their dependencies: `ade4`, `ape`, `genetics`, `nnet`, and `HWxtest`.

The RMarkdown is organized by analyses, using various packages for each.
